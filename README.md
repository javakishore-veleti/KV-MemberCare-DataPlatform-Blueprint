## 9. Enterprise Architecture Components (TOGAF BDAT Format)

### 9.1 Business Architecture

- Our business operations depend on accurate and timely handling of claims, eligibility checks, and provider management.
- We want to ensure that as soon as a member enrolls or a provider submits a claim, the right data is immediately available for downstream processing and insights.
- We aim to reduce the number of manual steps involved in managing claims, approvals, and communications between KV teams, providers, and members.
- We want to improve the experience for our users—whether they are members checking their benefits or finance teams running reports—by giving them clear, up-to-date, and easy-to-access information.
- As our services expand, we want to ensure our system design can support new mandates, health plans, and integrations without slowing us down.
