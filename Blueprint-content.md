As our services expand, we want to make sure our system design can support new state and federal mandates, evolving health plans, and partner integrations without slowing us down.Improve operational efficiency, decision-making, and transparency

8.2 Data Architecture

We are organizing data around the core domains of our healthcare payer model: Claims, Members, Providers, Plans, Financials, and Compliance.

Claims data will include both high-level summaries and line-level details, capturing real-time events like submissions, adjudication, pends, and payments.

Member data will include eligibility, enrollment periods, contact information, and plan assignments, with historical tracking for effective dates.

Provider data will include credentials, network status, and service coverage, aligned with claim and contract timelines.

Plan data will include coverage tiers, product types, and member assignments across time windows.

All raw data will be stored in S3 by date and domain. Curated data will be modeled as facts and dimensions in Redshift.

We will apply consistent timestamps and maintain versioned records using Type 2 history for auditing and analytics.

The data catalog will track ownership, update frequency, PII/PHI sensitivity, and usage policies.Organize data into Raw, Staging, Curated, Analytical zones in S3
